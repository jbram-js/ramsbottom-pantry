          We are a voluntary food pantry based in Ramsbottom. Our function is to
          be the arms that reach out to the community directly. We are a
          completely donation-driven food pantry that that relies on the local community's generosity to help those who need it.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Cost of Living crisis has brought unprecedented challenges to so many people's lives and
          have truly highlighted how anybody can be in need of emergency food at
          any time. There is no 'type' of person. When a crisis hits we aim to
          bridge the gap and offer our support. No matter your circumstances we
          are here to provide completely judgement free help.
          <br />
          <br />
          For just Â£5 a week anybody in need can come down to the pantry and
          select food, drink and sanitary items they wish from the categories
          outlined. We are open every Tuesdays & Thursdays between 10:00 - 12:00
          down at Christ Church Ramsbottom.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you are in need of any further help or support please do not
          hesitate to speak to one of our friendly volunteers. As much as
          possible, we can assist with putting you in contact with the local
          authorities for advice on what support you may be entitled to.
