        <strong>From the community, for the community.</strong>
        We are a voluntary food pantry based in Ramsbottom. Our function is to be the
        arms that reach out to the community directly. We are a completely donation driven
        food pantry who rely on the generosity of the local community to help those who 
        need it. 2020 has been a year like no other, anybody can be in need of emergency 
        food at anytime. There is no 'type' of person. When a crisis hits we aim to bridge
        the gap and offer our support. Whether you have been furloughed, had your ours 
        reduced, lost your job, waiting on a Universal Credit payment or had unexpected
        additional expenses we are here to help.
