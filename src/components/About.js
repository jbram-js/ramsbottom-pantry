          We are a voluntary food pantry based in Ramsbottom. Our function is to
          be the arms that reach out to the community directly. We are a
          completely donation driven food pantry who rely on the generosity of
          the local community to help those who need it.

          <br />
          The Cost of Living crisis and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic
          have brought unprecedented challenges to so many peoples lives, and
          have truly highlighted how anybody can be in need of emergency food at
          anytime. There is no 'type' of person. When a crisis hits we aim to
          bridge the gap and offer our support. No matter your circumstances we
          are here to provide completely judgement free help.
          <br />
          <br />
          For just Â£3 a week anybody in need can come down to the pantry and
          select food, drink and sanitary items they wish from the categories
          outlined. We are open Tuesdays & Thursdays between 12 - 2pm down at
          Christ Church Ramsbottom.
